\section*{Supplement B: Code Walkthrough}

Each demo script located in \texttt{artifact/code} reproduces a correspondence.
Run them with the \texttt{--ci} flag for a quick check.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{physics/landauer.py}: prints $k_B T\ln 2$ energy.
  \item \texttt{info/shannon_cap.py}: prints Shannon capacity.
  \item \texttt{control/pid_phi.py}: prints golden PID ratio.
  \item \texttt{ml/gd_energy.py}: shows loss decrease.
  \item \texttt{neuro/hh_spike.py}: shows membrane energy integral.
\end{enumerate}
