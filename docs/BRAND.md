# Veritas — Brand Core

> Elevator pitch
>
> “Veritas is a public ledger of your project's promises. Each promise is notarised by an automated check; when every contract holds you get a green `Whole-stamp`, otherwise the exact breach is reported instantly.”

## Three role-specific taglines

| Role  | Tagline |
|-------|---------|
| Individual | “My artefacts keep their own word.” |
| Team       | “Every dependency is an explicit promise, not hidden debt.” |
| CEO        | “Budget turns into measurable promises with a cryptographic trust-stamp.” |

## Glossary N-E-C (Node • Edge • Check)

| Symbol | Term | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| **N**  | *Node*              | Evidence or claim boundary: file, dataset, KPI. |
| **E**  | *Edge*              | A directed link *from → to* that declares an `obligation`. |
| **C**  | *Check*             | The plugin that validates (or falsifies) the obligation. |
| Whole-stamp | *Trust-stamp*  | The SHA-256 hash of the acyclic, gap-free DAG. |

## Tone of voice

* Minimalist — avoid jargon overflow.
* Human-friendly metaphors (notary, promise) sit next to technical terms (plugin, obligation).
* “Five-minute hurdle” — core marketing fact, referenced in every public text.
